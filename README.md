# BookStore_MERN

I created this Repo to get more into the MERN Stack and try to learn and understand more about webdevelopment using MongoDB, Express.js, React.js and Node.js.

This repo includes a frontend application and a backend application. The goal was to create a bookstore where you can create, edit and delete information about books such as author, publish Year and Title. 
I only build some sort of UI at /home and to make sure the routes are working fine I used postman. The frontend application was build with tailwind.css, JS, React and Vite. The frontend application as well holds pages as createBooks, DeleteBooks, EditBooks. After clicking buttons for add, edit, delete or information you get redirected to the page for adding, deleting, update and of course depending on the books id. So you only update one book f.e.

For the backend application I used node.js, and express.js. Database is MongoDB. I used the library mongoose. I created a BookModel, learned some about CORS and Routes and I made some fields mandatory for creating books. Depending on the response the application also logs messages to the console.

Fot this project I used a tutorial from freeCodeCamp.org. Thank you!
